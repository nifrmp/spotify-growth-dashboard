What to run (example):
  git clone --mirror https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git spotify-growth-dashboard-mirror.git

How to capture output:
  - Windows PowerShell: run the command and copy the entire output from the terminal.
  - Git Bash / macOS / Linux: run the command, then select and copy the terminal output.

If your command includes a token, replace it before pasting:
  https://<TOKEN>@github.com/your-username/your-repo.git  =>  https://<REDACTED>@github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

Paste here (exactly) both items:
1) The exact repo URL you used (copy-paste the URL only):
   e.g. https://github.com/nifrmp/spotify-growth-dashboard.git

2) The full terminal output you got when running the clone (copy-paste all lines).
   If you saw 'Repository not found' include the full clone command you ran.

Optional helpful context:
 - Is the repo public or private?
 - Are you authenticated (SSH key, GitHub CLI, or username/password/PAT)?
 - Which OS/terminal did you use? (PowerShell, Git Bash, macOS Terminal)

After you paste the URL and terminal output (redacting any tokens), I will:
 - Point out typos in the URL or permission issues.
 - Tell you the exact commands to run next and whether to use SSH or HTTPS.
 - If needed, provide guidance to install git-filter-repo or use BFG and the correct mirror workflow.
